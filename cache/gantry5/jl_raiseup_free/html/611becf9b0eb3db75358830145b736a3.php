							Once you have accepted a position, stay firm in your decision.

							University students if you renege on accepted offer.

					</ul>
					
					<h3>What do I do if I’m juggling multiple offers?</h3>
					<ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
						<li>
							Prioritize what you are looking for in an attachment/job and think of the
							aspects thereof. Consider work-life balance, your commute, salary, supervisor,
							benefits, flexible hours, available promotions, and the future of the organisation.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3> What should I do if I’ve already received one offer but I haven’t heard from my dream organization?</h3>

							finishing up with the recruiting process and you hope to finalise your decision by a
							specific date (usually not more than 2-3 weeks).
