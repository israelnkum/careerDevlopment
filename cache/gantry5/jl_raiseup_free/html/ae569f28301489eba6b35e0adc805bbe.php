							Verbal “thank you’s” aren’t enough, either. Go with handwritten thank you note. To each person you write,
							provide specifics about what you appreciated. Maybe they showed you the rope on a new project or made your
							lunch break more bearable by sharing a table with you. Whatever it is, avoid a canned response.

							Building your network is essential to the future of your career. Everyone you

							<br>
							Stay in touch with your fellow interns, co-workers and manager by connecting with
							them on social media sites. For instance, you can shoot your previous attachment
							manager an email, if you see the company has won an award, or check in with a former
							co-worker to see how things are going since you left.

							career counsellor to explore your next steps.
