						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>Get access to professionals who are specifically trained to assist you with your career-related concerns.</li>
						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>It’s the appropriate office on campus that provides useful information to enable you figure out what you want to do with your life, not only when you’re about to start your job hunt, but also when you want to learn more about yourself - your interests, skills, values, personality.</li>
						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>We work closely with employers who may someday hire you in order to develop internship and full-time opportunities for your future career.</li>
						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>Our Career Development staffs are ever ready to interact with you on daily basis so as to be conversant with your skills, strengths, weaknesses, potential, growth and development areas, etc. for reference to an employer who may be looking for your caliber to fill a specific position.</li>
						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>Career Development Office will not offer you a job; job searching is hard work and requires much effort on your part. We will expose you to a world of opportunities, resources and needed guidance which you will utilise to explore and develop yourself, in order to carve a thriving career.</li>
						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>Attend workshops offered by Career Development Office starting in your first year. The Career Development Office is for all students in the university, not just final year students. If you wait until your last semester to start visiting the Career Development Office, you have waited too long and may not find the assistance you are looking for. Get in early - meet the staff - and start developing your career early, and you will be put miles ahead of your mates.</li>
						<li><span uk-icon="triangle-right"></span>You are paying for it! Your fees have paid for the support the Career Development Office provides. Therefore, not taking advantage of it simply means you are not utilising some part of your fees.</li>
